Vincent Van Gough
One of the most famous artist in the world. 
He began to do art after his suicide.
He has more than 2100 paintings, which are the most famous paintings in the history of the Western Art.
His paintings include landscapes, sel-portraits,and portraits.
The Yellow house, Starry Night and Sunflowers are names of some of his paintings.

Van Gogh's life was characterized by unhappiness and mental illness. 
He was a heavy smoker.
Many of his paintings late in life reflect his chronic depression in their tone and use of color.

Van Gogh's body of work stands as a testament to the ability of an individual gripped by anguish for much of his life to create works of lasting beauty and even serenity. Even the works in his later, more melancholic style retain a sense of peace and reverance for nature which continues to enrapture those interested in his style of painting.

Van Gogh was poor when he was alive. After his death, his paintings become very worthy. Maybe because no one can create such meaningful paintings any more.
If he is alive, maybe he would be happy to see this.
